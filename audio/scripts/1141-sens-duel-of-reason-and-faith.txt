The cathedral at Sens rises massive against a June sky. Inside, Europe's most dangerous philosopher faces his accusers.

Peter Abelard is sixty-two years old. Twenty years ago, he was castrated by thugs hired by the uncle of Héloïse — his student, his lover, eventually his wife. The scandal should have destroyed him. Instead, he became the most famous teacher in Europe.

Now his enemy has cornered him. Bernard of Clairvaux, the honey-tongued mystic who bends popes to his will, waves parchments bearing Abelard's words: "By doubting we come to inquiry. By inquiry we perceive the truth."

Bernard's voice rings with horror. This man treats the Trinity as a syllogism!

Abelard opens his mouth to respond. Then stops. He sees the verdict already written in the judges' eyes. Without speaking a word in his defense, he appeals to Rome and walks out.

Bernard writes faster. Before Abelard's appeal reaches Italy, the Pope has condemned him to perpetual silence.

Twenty miles north of Paris, at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, a different kind of revolution is rising. Abbot Suger watches masons fit stones into something no one has seen before — walls that are mostly windows. Pointed arches and ribbed vaults distribute weight so precisely that stone becomes skeleton and light pours through. No one calls it Gothic yet. That name comes later, as an insult.

In Bologna, a monk named Gratian is reconciling centuries of contradictory church law using the same dialectical method Abelard applied to theology. His Decretum will govern Christendom for eight hundred years.

And across the Channel, Geoffrey of Monmouth is circulating his History of the Kings of Britain — a mythology invented whole from fragments and imagination. King Arthur, Merlin, Excalibur, Camelot. Not history. Something more powerful: a shared dream.

The twelfth century is waking up. Reason is being applied to faith. Faith is being transmuted into light. Law is becoming systematic. Story is becoming myth. 

When Abelard died the following year, Peter the Venerable — Abbot of Cluny — sent his body to Héloïse. She buried him at the Paraclete. Twenty-two years later, she was laid beside him. They're still there, in a shared tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Reason and faith fought at Sens. Neither won. Neither lost. They married instead — like two difficult people who can't live together and can't live apart.

We're still walking in their aftermath.
