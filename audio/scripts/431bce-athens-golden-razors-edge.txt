Athens. Four hundred and thirty-one BCE.

On the Acropolis, the Parthenon stands complete — the most ambitious building project the Greek world has ever seen. Begun sixteen years earlier under Pericles' direction, it is a temple to Athena, but it is also something else entirely: a statement that Athens is the centre of civilisation.

Inside stands Phidias's Athena Parthenos — thirteen metres of gold and ivory. The gold alone weighs over a thousand kilograms, roughly the city's annual tribute income from the Delian League — a defensive alliance that Athens has quietly transformed into an empire. The subject allies pay. Athens builds.

But the Parthenon is more than wealth made visible. No straight line in the building is truly straight. The columns swell subtly outward — a technique called entasis — to counteract the optical illusion that would make straight columns appear concave. The stylobate, the platform on which everything rests, curves gently upward. Corner columns are thickened and tilted inward. Dozens of mathematical corrections, invisible to the casual observer, designed to make the building appear perfect to the human eye. Architecture as epistemology: the truth must be adjusted to be perceived as true.

Meanwhile, at the Theatre of Dionysus below the Acropolis, the City Dionysia is underway. This year, Euripides presents Medea. He will place third — dead last — behind Euphorion, remembered today only for beating Euripides, and Sophocles, who comes second.

Medea is a detonation. A foreign woman, betrayed by her Greek husband Jason, murders their children and escapes unpunished on a divine chariot. Euripides grants her the logos — rational argument — that Athenian culture reserved for citizen men, and turns it into a weapon. The most rational character on stage is the barbarian woman. Athens the civilised, patron of reason, is forced to look in a mirror.

Tragedy itself is a democratic institution. The performances are publicly funded. The entire citizenry attends. The judges are selected by lottery. It is art, but it is also civic ritual — inseparable from the politics that funds the Parthenon and votes for war on the same day.

And the war has come. In this same year, the Peloponnesian War begins — Sparta and its allies invading Attica. Pericles' strategy: abandon the countryside, retreat behind the Long Walls connecting Athens to its port at Piraeus, and rely on the navy. Let the land burn. The sea will provide.

This is Athenian democracy at its most radical. The Assembly of all male citizens votes on war and peace, sets tribute rates, and commissions the building programme. But "all citizens" is a narrow category. Women are excluded. Slaves — perhaps a third of Attica's population — are excluded. Resident foreigners, the metics, are excluded. The silver that funds the navy comes from the mines at Laurion, worked by enslaved people. Democracy and slavery are not contradictions in the Athenian mind. They are the system.

In the Agora, philosophy is alive. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae — Pericles' teacher, his friend, his intellectual guide — has recently been tried for impiety and expelled from the city. His crime: declaring the sun not a god but a mass of red-hot metal larger than the Peloponnese. The moon, he said, was an earthy body reflecting borrowed light. His philosophical system proposed Nous — Mind — as the cosmic ordering principle: an intelligence that set the universe in motion from a primordial mixture. The first clean separation of mind from matter. For this, Athens rewarded him with exile.

Socrates is thirty-eight, walking the Agora, questioning anyone who will engage. He has written nothing. He will never write anything. We know him only through the accounts of others. Protagoras of Abdera, visiting the city, has declared that man is the measure of all things — the most radical statement of relativism the ancient world will produce.

Here is the circuit that makes Athens both extraordinary and unsustainable. The Parthenon's gold comes from tribute. The tribute comes from subject allies. The allies are held by naval force funded by enslaved silver miners. Imperial power, democratic art, and unfree labour form a single system.

Phidias has been charged with embezzling the Parthenon's gold — a political attack on Pericles through his associates, the same tactic used against Anaxagoras. The philosopher who said the sun was a rock and the sculptor who made Athena glow with stolen tribute — both threatened the city's self-image from different angles. Both were destroyed for it.

On stage, in stone, in argument — Athens in 431 is asking the questions that will define Western thought for the next twenty-five centuries. What do we owe the state? Can reason explain the cosmos? Who counts as human? What is the relationship between beauty and power?

The answers will not come before the war does. Within two years, plague will ravage the city packed behind its walls. Pericles himself will be dead by 429. The Peloponnesian War will last twenty-seven years and end with Athens' surrender.

But the Parthenon will stand. Euripides' Medea will endure. Anaxagoras's Nous will travel — through Plato, through Aristotle, through the Arab translators of Baghdad, through the Latin scholars of medieval Europe — all the way to Descartes and Kant, who will still be arguing about the relationship between mind and matter.

Four thirty-one BCE. The golden razor's edge — the single year when everything Athens built was still intact, and everything it would lose was already in motion.
