August 24th, 410. The unthinkable happens.

For the first time in eight hundred years, a foreign army enters Rome. Alaric's Visigoths pour through the Salarian Gate, and for three days they sack the Eternal City. The shock reverberates across the Mediterranean.

In Bethlehem, Jerome — the greatest scholar of his age — sets down his pen. "My voice sticks in my throat," he writes. "The city which had taken the whole world was itself taken."

But in North Africa, a bishop named Augustine sees something different. Where Jerome sees only catastrophe, Augustine sees a question. If Rome was the chosen instrument of God's providence, if it spread Christianity across the world — then why would God allow it to fall?

Pagan critics have an easy answer: the old gods are punishing Rome for abandoning them. Augustine spends the next thirteen years writing his response — the City of God. It is nothing less than the first Christian philosophy of history.

His argument is revolutionary. There are two cities, Augustine says, woven together throughout human history. The earthly city, built on self-love — and the heavenly city, built on love of God. Rome was never truly eternal. No earthly kingdom is. The sack of 410 proves not that Christianity failed Rome, but that Rome was never the point.

This is a staggering shift. Before Augustine, Christians assumed the Roman Empire was part of God's plan. After Augustine, Christians can imagine a future without Rome — and that imagination makes the medieval world possible.

Meanwhile, Jerome finishes his Vulgate — his Latin translation of the Bible that will become the standard text of Western Christianity for a thousand years. And the poet Prudentius, the last great Christian Latin poet, is composing allegories where virtues battle vices in the human soul.

The old world is dying. But in its death, something new is being born. Augustine, Jerome, Prudentius — working in different cities, responding to the same catastrophe — are laying the foundations of medieval thought.

The city of man has fallen. The City of God endures.
