Athens, 399 BCE. A city still raw from civil war puts its most famous philosopher on trial.

Five years earlier, the Thirty Tyrants — imposed by Sparta after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Peloponnesian War — had executed fifteen hundred citizens and exiled thousands more in just eight months. The democracy was restored by revolution, followed by an extraordinary amnesty that forbade prosecuting anyone for crimes committed under the oligarchy.

But the amnesty had a loophole. You couldn't charge Socrates for his students' crimes — Critias, who led the Thirty, or Alcibiades, who defected to Sparta. So Athens found other words: impiety. Corrupting the youth. Everyone in the courtroom knew what was really on trial.

While the city argued about its philosopher, its artists were arguing about reality itself. The painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius had staged a legendary contest — Zeuxis painted grapes so real that birds pecked at them, then Parrhasius painted a curtain so convincing that Zeuxis asked him to pull it aside. Trompe l'oeil: art that fools the eye. And Socrates had been right there in conversation with Parrhasius, pushing him further — can painting capture not just the body, but the soul?

In the theatres, Aristophanes' Clouds had already done its damage. That comedy — staging Socrates as a charlatan who teaches people to make weak arguments strong and replaces Zeus with a vortex of air — had been playing for twenty-four years. Plato would later write that it poisoned the jury pool more than any formal charge.

And in music, Timotheus of Miletus was scandalising traditionalists by adding strings to the kithara, allowing chromatic modulations that Spartans literally cut from his instrument. The accusation was the same one levelled at Socrates: corruption through innovation.

When the jury of five hundred and one citizens voted to convict, Socrates could have proposed exile. He proposed free meals instead. When his friend Crito arranged an escape — bribes, a boat, safe passage to Thessaly — Socrates refused. Breaking the law, even an unjust one, would destroy the social contract that made philosophy possible.

He drank the hemlock. And in doing so, gave democracy its most uncomfortable question: what happens when freedom votes to silence the free mind?
