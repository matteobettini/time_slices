The year is 1687, and the universe is about to become a machine.

In July, a book emerges from London's printing presses that will reshape human understanding of reality itself. Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica proves that a single mathematical law — the inverse square of gravitational attraction — governs the motion of planets, moons, comets, tides, and falling apples. The cosmos is no longer a mystery. It's an equation.

But Newton almost didn't publish at all. The Royal Society was broke — they'd spent their funds on an extravagantly illustrated fish book that nobody bought. So Edmond Halley, the astronomer who would later predict the return of his famous comet, paid from his own pocket. Fish nearly delayed the Scientific Revolution.

The Principia didn't fall from a clear sky. Three years earlier, Halley visited Newton in Cambridge and posed a question that mathematicians had been racing to solve: what curve would a planet describe under an inverse-square law? Newton answered immediately — an ellipse. He'd already worked it out. Halley, stunned, pushed him to publish.

Across the Channel, the same intellectual ferment was brewing. John Locke, in exile in Amsterdam fleeing Stuart persecution, was drafting his Essay Concerning Human Understanding — the empiricist foundation that matched Newton's physics with a theory of mind. All knowledge, Locke argued, comes from sensory experience. No innate ideas. No divine revelation needed.

And in the same year, across Europe, the old order was cracking open. Louis XIV had revoked the Edict of Nantes, driving hundreds of thousands of French Protestants into exile — carrying skills, capital, and ideas into England, Holland, and Prussia. In Athens, a Venetian cannonball struck the Parthenon, which the Ottomans were using as a gunpowder magazine. The explosion destroyed much of a building that had stood for twenty-one centuries.

The Baroque composer Lully died from an absurd wound — he'd struck his own foot with his conducting staff during a performance. The age of spectacle was killing its own artists.

Something was ending. Something else was beginning. Newton's laws reduced the heavens to mechanics. The Glorious Revolution, just eighteen months away, would reduce kings to constitutional figureheads. The world was clicking into place — ordered, predictable, governed by laws that humans could discover.

The gravity of reason had begun to pull everything into its orbit.
