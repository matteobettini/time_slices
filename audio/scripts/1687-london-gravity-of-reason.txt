In 1687, Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica — a book that would fundamentally change how humans understand the physical world.

Newton demonstrated that a single mathematical principle, the inverse-square law of gravitational attraction, could explain the motion of everything from falling apples to orbiting planets. The same force that pulls objects to Earth also keeps the Moon in its path and governs the trajectories of comets. For the first time, the cosmos was shown to operate by discoverable, mathematical laws.

The book almost didn't happen. The Royal Society, which would normally fund such publications, had exhausted its budget on an elaborately illustrated volume about fish that sold poorly. So Edmond Halley — the astronomer who would later calculate the orbit of his famous comet — paid for the Principia's publication himself.

Newton wasn't working in isolation. Across the Channel, John Locke was drafting his Essay Concerning Human Understanding while in exile in Amsterdam, developing the empiricist philosophy that would complement Newton's physics. Meanwhile, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had independently invented calculus and was building his own metaphysical system.

The broader context of 1687 was equally significant. Louis XIV had recently revoked the Edict of Nantes, sending hundreds of thousands of French Protestants into exile across Europe, carrying skills and ideas with them. In Athens, Venetian forces besieging the Ottoman-held city fired a cannonball that struck the Parthenon, destroying much of a building that had survived over two thousand years.

Even the arts reflected the era's tensions. The composer Lully, who had dominated French music for decades, died from gangrene after accidentally striking his foot with his conducting staff during a performance.

Within eighteen months, the Glorious Revolution would transform English governance. The intellectual and political order of Europe was being reshaped — and Newton's laws gave that transformation a new foundation: a universe governed not by divine whim, but by principles that human reason could discover and describe.
