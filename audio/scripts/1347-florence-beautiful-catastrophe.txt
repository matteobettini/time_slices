In the autumn of 1347, a fleet of Genoese trading ships limps into the harbor at Messina, Sicily. The sailors are dying. Black swellings bulge from their necks and groins. The harbormaster orders the ships out, but it's already too late.

Within months, the Black Death will kill a third of Europe.

In Florence — banking capital of the world, city of sixty thousand souls — the plague arrives like a philosophical argument made flesh. The old abstractions don't hold anymore. The Church says suffering is God's punishment, but priests die as fast as sinners. The universities teach that universal categories are the foundation of knowledge, but William of Ockham — who dies this very year, likely of plague — has already taken his razor to that idea. Only individuals exist, he insists. Only what you can observe is real. The rest is just names we've given things.

And then Death comes and proves him right. Universals won't save you. Your body is your body, and it's dying.

But here's the miracle: from this catastrophe, something extraordinary grows.

Giovanni Boccaccio, watching Florence die, writes the Decameron — a hundred stories told by ten young people who've fled the plague for a villa in the countryside. They tell tales to hold death at bay: bawdy, tender, savage, funny. And he writes them not in Latin — the language of the Church and the academy — but in Tuscan Italian. The vernacular. The language people actually speak. It's literature stepping off the altar and into the street.

Meanwhile, painters discover what the poets already know: death makes everything vivid. The Triumph of Death becomes Europe's defining image — skeletal horses trampling nobles and beggars alike. But look closer at these paintings and you'll see something surprising: the dying figures are rendered with extraordinary tenderness. Their bodies are real. Their suffering is specific. Art has learned to see individuals, just as Ockham's philosophy demands.

The plague strips away abstraction and forces Europe to look at what's actually there. In the rubble, the seeds of a new world. 

Florence will recover. And when it does, it will build the Renaissance.
