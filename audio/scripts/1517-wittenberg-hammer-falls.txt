October 31st, 1517. A German monk walks up to the Castle Church in Wittenberg with a document in hand. Whether Martin Luther actually hammered ninety-five theses to that door or simply sent them to the Archbishop is still debated — what's certain is that within two weeks, printing presses had spread his arguments across Germany. Within three years, three hundred thousand copies were circulating through Europe.

Luther's target was indulgences — the Church's practice of selling forgiveness. But the implications ran deeper. He was attacking papal authority itself. The idea that salvation could be bought, that the Pope could unlock heaven's gates for the right price — this, Luther argued, was a corruption of Scripture.

At that very moment in Rome, Raphael's School of Athens stood in the Vatican, a masterpiece celebrating the harmony of ancient wisdom and Christian truth. Plato and Aristotle at the center, surrounded by every great thinker from Pythagoras to Averroes. It was the visual manifesto of Renaissance confidence — the belief that faith and reason formed one beautiful system.

In London, Thomas More had just published Utopia, imagining a society of religious tolerance and rational government. His friend Erasmus had released a Greek edition of the New Testament, using scholarly methods to correct errors in the official Latin Bible.

These men were the Christian humanists — believers who thought learning could purify the Church. They wanted reform, not revolution. Erasmus had satirized Church corruption brilliantly. But when Luther's hammer fell — metaphorical or not — it shattered something irreparable.

The same printing technology that spread More's Utopia through humanist circles spread Luther's theses like wildfire. Pope Leo the Tenth, patron of Raphael, seller of indulgences, watched as his world split in two.

Raphael and Luther shared one premise: that ancient wisdom could illuminate truth. But they drew opposite conclusions. The painter showed philosophy and Christianity dancing together. The reformer insisted that Scripture alone must judge tradition.

Renaissance and Reformation aren't opposites. The second is the first, pushed past its breaking point.
