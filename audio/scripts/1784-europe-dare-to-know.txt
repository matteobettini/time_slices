In December 1784, a short essay appears in a Berlin magazine. The question it answers has been posed as a kind of intellectual dare: What is Enlightenment?

Immanuel Kant's answer is two words: Sapere aude. Dare to know.

Have the courage to use your own understanding, he writes, from a small university town in East Prussia where he has lived his entire life, taking the same walk at the same time every day with such regularity that his neighbors set their clocks by him. This quiet, methodical man is detonating the foundations of Western thought.

Kant has already published the Critique of Pure Reason — the most important and most difficult philosophical work of the modern age. His argument: the human mind doesn't passively receive reality. It actively structures it. Space, time, causation — these aren't features of the world out there. They're the architecture of how we think. The mind builds the world it experiences.

It sounds abstract, but follow the thread to Paris and you'll see what it means in practice.

On the twenty-seventh of April, Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro finally premieres after three years of royal censorship. Louis the Sixteenth reportedly said the play would be dangerous to perform. He was right. Figaro — a servant — stands on stage and asks why his aristocratic master deserves anything, simply for having been born. The audience roars. The old order laughs at itself, not realizing it's writing its own death sentence. Five years from now, the Bastille will fall.

And in Rome, Jacques-Louis David is finishing the painting that will become the revolution's visual manifesto before the revolution even starts. The Oath of the Horatii shows three brothers swearing to die for the republic — rigid, geometric, stripped of all Baroque excess. Duty over pleasure. The collective over the individual. It's Enlightenment rationalism painted in the language of ancient Rome.

Everything connects through Paris. David exhibits at the Salon where Beaumarchais' audiences gather. French officers just back from fighting in the American Revolution fill the salons where these ideas circulate. Benjamin Franklin, ambassador to France, is treated like a celebrity philosopher.

Kant dared humanity to think for itself. Within five years, France will dare something more: to act on that thought.
