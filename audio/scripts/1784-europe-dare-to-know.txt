December 1784. In a provincial Prussian city called Königsberg, a man who has never traveled more than ten miles from his birthplace publishes an essay that will reshape civilization.

The question is simple: What is Enlightenment? Immanuel Kant's answer is two words of Latin — Sapere aude. Dare to know.

Have courage, he writes, to use your own understanding. The obstacle to thinking isn't stupidity — it's fear. It's easier to let priests think for you, to let princes decide for you. But humanity must grow up. Must think for itself.

This quiet professor, so punctual that his neighbors set their clocks by his daily walk, has just lit a fuse that will explode across Europe.

Four months earlier in Paris, a play finally reaches the stage after three years of royal censorship. Louis XVI had reportedly called it dangerous. He was right.

In Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro, a servant outsmarts his aristocratic master. In the fifth act, Figaro turns to the audience and asks: What have you done to deserve your advantages? You took the trouble to be born — nothing more.

The audience roars. The nobility laughs at itself, not realizing it's laughing at its own funeral.

And in Rome, Jacques-Louis David is finishing a painting that will become revolution's visual language before revolution even arrives. The Oath of the Horatii shows three brothers swearing to die for the republic — rigid, geometric, stripped of every Rococo curve. Duty over pleasure. The collective over the self. When it reaches the Paris Salon, the crowds understand instantly. This is what virtue looks like.

Everything connects through Paris. David exhibits where Beaumarchais' audiences gather. French officers just back from fighting alongside American revolutionaries fill the salons. Benjamin Franklin is treated like a celebrity philosopher. The debt from that American war is bankrupting the treasury.

Kant in Königsberg, Beaumarchais on stage, David in his studio — none of them correspond directly. What connects them isn't letters. It's the same crisis of legitimacy, the same old order crumbling under its own contradictions.

Five years from now, the Bastille will fall. But in 1784, the Enlightenment has already said everything that needs saying.

Dare to know. Then dare to act.
