In the year 125, a hole in the ceiling is the most radical idea in the world.

The Pantheon is nearly finished. Hadrian — emperor, architect, restless traveller — has rebuilt it from the ground up, replacing Agrippa's old temple with something unprecedented: a concrete dome forty-three metres across, the largest unsupported span on earth, with a single round opening at its apex. The oculus. No glass. No covering. Rain falls onto the marble floor. Sunlight tracks across the coffered interior like a cosmic clock. The building is open to the sky the way Stoic philosophy is open to fate — not resisting the world, but containing it.

This is the Roman Empire at its zenith. Hadrian governs sixty million people across three continents. But where Trajan pushed the borders to Mesopotamia, Hadrian pulls them back. He builds walls — in Britain, in North Africa — not to seal the empire but to define it. Consolidation, not expansion. A mature civilisation choosing its limits.

In a modest school in Nicopolis, a former slave named Epictetus is teaching the doctrine that will shape Western ethics for two millennia: the only things in your power are your judgements and choices. Everything else belongs to fortune. His student Arrian transcribes the teachings. Fifty years later, they reach Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The philosophy of the empire's most powerless man becomes the private discipline of its most powerful.

Meanwhile, Juvenal coins "bread and circuses." Suetonius, recently dismissed as Hadrian's secretary, publishes The Twelve Caesars — biography from inside the palace. Tacitus has just completed the most psychologically penetrating histories Rome will ever produce. And Plutarch's Parallel Lives has given the world its template for understanding greatness.

The Pantheon survives. It stands now in Rome, its dome still the largest unreinforced concrete span ever built. Hadrian kept Agrippa's name on the façade. His masterpiece, signed by someone who never built it.
