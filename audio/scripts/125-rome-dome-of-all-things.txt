In the year 125, a dome rises over Rome that shouldn't be possible.

Forty-three metres across, unreinforced concrete, with a single hole at the top open to the sky. Rain falls through it. Sunlight moves across the coffers like a slow clock. The Pantheon is a temple to all the gods — but it feels like a temple to geometry itself.

The man behind it is Hadrian, and he is not your typical emperor. He designs buildings. He writes poetry in Greek. He walks the borders of his empire on foot, inspecting every garrison, every wall. He is building one right now in Britain — a stone line across the island, not to stop the barbarians but to manage the flow. Hadrian doesn't conquer. He consolidates. He curates.

And that instinct — the curator-emperor — defines everything about this moment.

Consider what's happening in Roman letters. Plutarch has just died, leaving behind his Parallel Lives: forty-six biographies pairing a Greek hero with a Roman one. Theseus with Romulus. Alexander with Caesar. It's the first systematic attempt to compare civilizations through their great men — and it will shape how the West writes biography for the next two thousand years, straight through Shakespeare to Napoleon.

Meanwhile, Suetonius — who was Hadrian's personal secretary until the emperor fired him — has published The Twelve Caesars, using his privileged access to imperial archives to reveal what happened behind closed doors. The biographer was inside the palace. The gossip came from the filing cabinets.

And Juvenal is writing satire so sharp that his phrases will outlive Latin itself. Bread and circuses. Who watches the watchmen. Panem et circenses. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.

But the deepest current runs through philosophy. In a small school in Nicopolis, in north-western Greece, a former slave named Epictetus is teaching something radical. Not radical in the way of revolutionaries — radical in the way of someone who has been broken and rebuilt.

Epictetus was born enslaved. His leg was crippled — by his master, some sources say. And from this wreckage he developed a philosophy of absolute inner sovereignty: the only things truly in your control are your own judgements. Everything else — health, wealth, reputation, even your body — belongs to fortune. Don't fight it. Master what you can.

His student Arrian, who is also a Roman consul and military commander, is writing it all down. The Discourses. The Handbook. And fifty years from now, the most powerful man on earth — Marcus Aurelius — will open his private journal and list Epictetus among his greatest debts. The philosophy of a crippled slave, transmitted through the pen of a consul, reaching an emperor.

This is the Roman Empire at its peak. Seventy million people. Three continents. Eighty thousand kilometres of roads. The Five Good Emperors. Gibbon will call it the happiest age in human history — which was true if you weren't one of the millions of slaves. But the administrative machinery works. The aqueducts flow. The law holds.

And at the center of it all, a dome with a hole in it. Open to rain, open to stars, open to the sky.

There's something the Pantheon does that no building had done before. Its height equals its diameter. A perfect sphere would fit inside it, touching the floor and the dome's apex. It is mathematically exact in a way that makes a philosophical claim: the cosmos has rational structure, and human craft can embody it.

An emperor who hid his masterpiece behind another man's name — the inscription still credits Agrippa, who built the original a century earlier. A philosopher who found freedom in slavery. Biographers who placed the private life at the center of history. A dome open to the weather.

The Roman Empire won't last. But the Pantheon will stand for two thousand years. Epictetus will be read by everyone from Montaigne to James Stockdale in a Vietnamese prison camp. Plutarch's method — compare, contrast, judge — will become how we think about great lives.

Some things outlast the empires that build them.
