The year 1889 begins with a collapse.

In January, in a street in Turin, Friedrich Nietzsche sees a horse being beaten. He throws his arms around the animal's neck, weeping, and never recovers. The philosopher who declared God dead loses his own mind. His productive life is over. But the books he's already written — Twilight of the Idols, published this very year — will detonate across the next century like delayed charges.

And in Paris, everything is rising.

The Eiffel Tower opens for the World's Fair, celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. Three hundred meters of iron lattice — the tallest structure on Earth — engineering made vertical, the Second Industrial Revolution announcing itself in metal and mathematics. The artists hate it. Maupassant says he eats lunch at its restaurant because it's the only place in Paris where you can't see the damn thing.

But the artists are busy detonating their own revolution.

In the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, Vincent van Gogh paints The Starry Night. Eleven turbulent spirals above a sleeping village — it's not what the sky looks like, it's what it feels like. Post-Impressionism is shattering the Impressionist consensus. Where Monet captured light, Van Gogh captures inner experience. Where Cézanne builds geometry from landscapes, Toulouse-Lautrec flattens the Moulin Rouge into electric poster art. Each painter is breaking the same rule: the canvas doesn't show the world. The canvas shows consciousness encountering the world.

And in Paris, a young philosopher named Henri Bergson publishes his doctoral thesis and introduces an idea that connects everything: duration. Lived time — the time you actually experience — is nothing like clock time. It flows, bends, accumulates. Your past isn't behind you; it's inside you, shaping every perception.

This is exactly what Van Gogh is painting. What Mallarmé is writing in poems that fracture syntax to capture how thought actually moves. What Debussy is composing in music that dissolves harmonic structure into floating sensation.

Nietzsche collapses. The tower rises. The painters explode. And Bergson quietly explains what they're all discovering: that reality isn't what the positivists measured. It's something stranger, more fluid, more alive.

Everything is changing. And it knows it.
