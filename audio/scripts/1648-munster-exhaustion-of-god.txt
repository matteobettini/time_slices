After thirty years of war, the negotiators gather in two towns in Westphalia — Catholics in Münster, Protestants in Osnabrück — and they are exhausted.

The Thirty Years' War has killed eight million people. Germany has lost a third of its population. Entire regions are depopulated. Mercenary armies wander the countryside like plagues with swords. And the cause of all this? A question no battlefield can answer: whose God gets to rule?

The Peace of Westphalia, signed in 1648, answers with a revolutionary idea. Nobody's God rules. States rule. Each prince determines the religion of his territory. The principle sounds modest, but it's a bomb thrown at a thousand years of European political theology. Before Westphalia, sovereignty flowed from God through the Church to kings. After Westphalia, sovereignty is just... sovereignty. A thing states have because they have it.

Meanwhile, in the Dutch Republic — the other great winner of this settlement, finally free from Spain after eighty years — a different kind of revolution is happening. Rembrandt van Rijn is painting light like a philosopher. His works don't illustrate theology; they investigate it. The light in a Rembrandt isn't divine illumination — it's a question about what we can actually see and what remains in shadow. The Baroque dominates everywhere else, overwhelming the senses with Counter-Reformation spectacle. But Dutch Baroque goes inward. Domestic. A woman reading a letter. An old man thinking. The heroic scaled down to the human.

And in a quiet room in that same republic, René Descartes has already done what the treaty negotiators are doing, but in philosophy. He has doubted everything — God, the world, his own body — until he reaches the one thing that can't be doubted: the fact that he's doubting. I think, therefore I am. A new foundation for knowledge that doesn't depend on revelation.

Descartes lives in Holland precisely because it tolerates free thought. Rembrandt paints in Amsterdam because its merchant economy doesn't need Catholic patrons. The war ends with a settlement that enshrines what the Dutch already practice: you can think what you want.

Three different men — a diplomat, a painter, a philosopher — arriving at the same conclusion from different directions. The old authorities are spent. Reason will have to do.
