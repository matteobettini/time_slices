Lyon, twelve seventy-four. A year when giants fall.

In March, Thomas Aquinas dies at the abbey of Fossanova, on his way to a council that will try to heal the thousand-year rift between East and West. He leaves behind the Summa Theologica — unfinished. The most ambitious attempt in Western history to reconcile faith and reason, abandoned three months earlier with a cryptic explanation: "All that I have written seems like straw compared to what has now been revealed to me."

What did he see? He never said.

Four months later, at the Council of Lyon itself, Bonaventure collapses and dies. He was there as a cardinal, helping negotiate a false peace between Rome and Constantinople. The Seraphic Doctor — Thomas's great counterweight, the Franciscan mystic who argued that the soul rises to God not through Aristotelian logic but through Augustinian illumination.

The two greatest philosophical minds of the thirteenth century, gone within weeks of each other. Two rival visions of how faith and reason dance together — both silenced.

And surrounding them, the age of the cathedral-builders reaches its zenith. Across France, the Rayonnant style is transforming stone into light. The walls of Sainte-Chapelle have practically disappeared — replaced by vast windows that make the building glow from within. Reims Cathedral nears completion. It's architecture that shares Scholasticism's ambition: making the invisible visible, proving divine order through human structure.

But the Council of Lyon fails. The Byzantine delegates accept papal authority — and go home to universal rejection. The union lasts barely eight years. In Italy, Cimabue is quietly revolutionizing painting, giving the Virgin new weight, new presence. In Florence, a nine-year-old boy named Dante sees a girl named Beatrice for the first time.

The medieval synthesis is complete — and already cracking. Within seventy years, the Black Death will empty these cathedrals, and nominalism will dissolve the certainties that Aquinas and Bonaventure tried to build.

Twelve seventy-four. The apex. The hinge. The end of the beginning.
