Nineteen twenty-two. The old world isn't dying — it's already dead. And in a single year, everything that will replace it arrives at once.

In Paris, a bookshop called Shakespeare and Company publishes a novel that the English-speaking world has banned. James Joyce's Ulysses takes a single day in Dublin — June 16th, 1904 — and explodes it into seven hundred pages of every narrative technique ever invented and several nobody has tried. Stream of consciousness. Parody. Hallucination. An entire chapter written as a play. The novel as total experiment. Nothing will be the same after this.

In London, T.S. Eliot publishes The Waste Land — four hundred and thirty-four lines of fragments. "These fragments I have shored against my ruins." The poem doesn't describe the postwar world. It is the postwar world: broken, allusive, haunted by voices, held together by nothing but the reader's desperate attempt to make sense.

In Richmond, Virginia Woolf publishes Jacob's Room and discovers what will become her signature: consciousness itself as narrative. Not what happens, but what it feels like while it's happening. Time in Woolf doesn't march. It pools.

In Weimar, the Bauhaus is in full swing. Gropius, Klee, Kandinsky, Moholy-Nagy — teaching the radical idea that art, craft, and industry should merge. Form follows function, but beauty isn't abandoned. It's rebuilt from geometry. The Constructivists and De Stijl converge here, creating a visual language that will define the twentieth century: clean lines, primary colors, the machine aesthetic made humane.

In Vienna — or rather, arriving from Vienna via England — Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus appears in English. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. Philosophy's problems are really problems of language. Logical positivism is born: only what can be verified means anything. Everything else is, literally, nonsense.

And in the world outside the books and galleries, the forces that will consume it all are taking shape. The Soviet Union is formally established. Mussolini marches on Rome. Fascism and communism both promise to rebuild the fragmented world through total systems.

Everything connects through fragmentation. Eliot's poem is literally fragments. Joyce fragments narrative into a dozen styles. The Bauhaus fragments art into geometry. Wittgenstein fragments language into logic. Even the new political movements are responses to a world that feels shattered.

Nineteen twenty-two doesn't just describe modernity. It is the moment modernity becomes self-aware.
