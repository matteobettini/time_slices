In the year 1610, how humans see the world changes forever. In March, Galileo Galilei publishes Sidereus Nuncius — the Starry Messenger — in Venice. For the first time, a book claims to describe what the telescope reveals. Mountains on the Moon. Our satellite is not a perfect sphere. Hundreds of stars invisible to the naked eye swarm the Milky Way. And strangest of all: four small bodies circling Jupiter. Moons. Worlds orbiting a world. The Aristotelian cosmos, with its perfect crystalline spheres centered on Earth, shatters in forty pages of Latin. This is the scientific revolution's first published victory: not a metaphor, not a theory, but direct observation. What you can see changes what you can believe. Galileo is forty-six, a mathematician at the University of Padua, where he has taught since 1592. He did not invent the telescope. Dutch spectacle-makers did that around 1608. But Galileo understood what it could do. He ground better lenses. He aimed it at the heavens. And he described what he saw with the precision of someone who knows that language must now serve evidence. The book is dedicated to Cosimo II de' Medici. Court science is born: knowledge as gift to power, protection in exchange for prestige. The Medici will nurture Galileo. Eventually, they will fail to save him. In Rome, Caravaggio dies in July under mysterious circumstances on the Tuscan coast. He is thirty-eight. His revolution is already complete: the tenebrism that replaced Renaissance idealization with the unflinching observation of actual bodies in actual light. The Calling of Saint Matthew. The Conversion of Paul. Light catches surprised mortals in darkened rooms. His Baroque is the artistic twin of Galileo's telescope — both insist on seeing what is actually there. Shakespeare writes The Tempest around this time, Prospero's island full of spirits and unreliable visions. Cervantes works on Don Quixote's second part, expanding the novel as form. And in France, Henry IV is assassinated in May by a Catholic fanatic — removing the continent's most effective monarch and destabilizing the balance he maintained. Thirty years of war await. But in 1610, the telescope opens first. What was thought perfect reveals itself as irregular. What was thought central reveals itself as merely one point among many. The universe becomes larger, stranger, and suddenly — for those with instruments — visible.
