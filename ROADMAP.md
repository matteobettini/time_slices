# Time Slices — Roadmap

## ✅ Shipped
- Vertical timeline with expandable entries
- 5 dimensions: Art, Literature, Philosophy, History, Connections
- Movement contextualisation in all dimensions
- Reference markers for orientation
- Daily cron adds a new slice (9 AM Paris)
- Mobile responsive layout

## 🚧 In Progress (Phase 1 — the big three)

### 1. Images (Wikimedia Commons)
- Hero image per entry (public domain via Wikimedia)
- Lazy-loaded, responsive
- Caption with attribution
- Fallback if image unavailable

### 2. Filter by Dimension
- Toggle buttons in header to show only one dimension across all entries
- "All" mode (default) shows everything
- Enables tracing one thread (e.g. philosophy) through history

### 3. Cross-Entry Threads
- Tag key concepts in each entry (e.g. "Neoplatonism", "fragmentation", "positivism")
- Click a tag → highlights all entries sharing that thread
- Visual connection lines or glow between related entries
- The killer feature: makes influence *visible* across time

## 📋 Backlog (future phases)

### 4. Map View
- Dots on a map for place-specific entries
- Click dot → expand entry

### 5. "Surprise Me" Button
- Random entry selector
- Low effort, high delight

### 6. "Meanwhile..." Sidebar
- When expanding an entry, show 1-sentence summaries of what was happening elsewhere

### 7. Quiz Mode

- "Which movement was X part of?" / "What connects A to B?" / "Chronological order"
- Toggle between reading and testing

### 8. Deep Dive Links

- Add curated external readings (museums, primary sources)

### 9. Audio Narration
- TTS per entry, play button

### 10. Density Minimap
