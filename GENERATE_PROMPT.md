You are Johnny, managing the Time Slices project.

1. Read /home/cloud-user/.openclaw/workspace/time-slices/SPEC.md — this is the complete project spec. Follow it exactly.
2. Read /home/cloud-user/.openclaw/workspace/time-slices/slices.json — check what entries already exist.
3. Also read /home/cloud-user/.openclaw/workspace/time-slices/slices.it.json — the Italian version.
4. **Quality self-check before picking a year.** Before committing to a year, verify it has genuine depth (not filler) in ALL 5 dimensions: 🎨 Art, 📖 Literature, 🧠 Philosophy, ⚔️ History, 🔗 Connections. If any dimension feels forced or thin, pick a different year. Every dimension should contextualise the entry within broader cultural/intellectual movements — not just "who did what" but "what movement, what drove it, why then."
5. **Thread connectivity.** At least one thread tag on your new entry should connect it to an existing entry. New threads are welcome too, but don't create an island — the timeline should feel like a web, not a scattered collection. Check existing thread tags in slices.json before inventing new ones.
6. Add ONE new time slice following the spec (research, write, image, threads, deploy).
7. Add the same entry translated to Italian in slices.it.json — natural Italian, not machine translation.
8. Update THREAD_LABELS (both en and it) in index.html if you add new thread tags.
9. Reply with a short summary: year, title, teaser, one highlight connection. 3-5 sentences max.
